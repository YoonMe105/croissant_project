        <h1>🥐 Croissant</h1>

        <p>A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of
            the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.
            Croissants
            are named
            for their historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in
            succession,
            then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky
            texture,
            similar to a puff pastry.</p>
